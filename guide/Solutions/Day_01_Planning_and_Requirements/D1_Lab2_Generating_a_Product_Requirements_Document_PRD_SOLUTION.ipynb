    "We begin by setting up our environment and loading the key artifact from Lab 1: `day1_user_stories.json`. The `load_artifact` helper function reads the file content, and `json.loads` parses the JSON string into a Python list of dictionaries, making it ready for use in our prompts."

    "This is a more advanced and practical task. Providing a template gives us much greater control over the final output. The LLM's task shifts from creative writing to structured content generation. We instruct it to fill in every section, which forces it to infer logical content for sections like \"Success Metrics\" and \"Out of Scope\" based on the provided requirements. This is a powerful pattern for creating consistent documentation."

    "This is the most advanced challenge. We are now using an LLM to write *code that validates documents*. Generating a Pydantic model turns our document's structure into a testable, code-based standard. This is a form of 'documentation-as-code' that allows for automated governance, ensuring all future PRDs conform to the same reliable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Prompting for Code:** We give the LLM the PRD template and ask it to generate a Pydantic model. Pydantic is a data validation library, and using it to define our document structure turns that structure into a testable, reusable standard.\n",
    "2.  **Saving the Model:** We save the generated Python code to a specific location (`app/validation_models/prd_model.py`). This isn't just a temporary script; it's a formal part of our application's codebase, intended to be used for future validation tasks.\n",
    "3.  **Saving the PRD:** Finally, we save the markdown PRD generated in the intermediate step. This becomes the official `day1_prd.md` artifact for our project."

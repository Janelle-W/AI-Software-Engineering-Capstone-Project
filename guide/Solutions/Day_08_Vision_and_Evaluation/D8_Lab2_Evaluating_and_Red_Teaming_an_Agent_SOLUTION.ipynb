You've learned how to use LLM-as-a-Judge for automated quality scoring, how to implement critical safety guardrails, and how to use an adversarial \"Red Team\" agent to proactively discover vulnerabilities. These skills are absolutely essential for any developer building production-grade AI applications.\n",

Using AI to automate both evaluation (LLM-as-a-Judge) and security probing (Red Teaming) is a state-of-the-art practice for building robust and trustworthy agents."

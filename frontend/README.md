# Frontend Folder - The User Interface

## What This Folder Does (Simple Explanation)
This folder contains everything that you see and interact with when using the chatbot. It's like the front desk of a hotel - it's what customers see and where they interact with the service. The frontend takes your questions, sends them to the smart backend system, and then displays the answers in a user-friendly way. It includes the chat interface, buttons, styling, and all the visual elements that make the application easy to use.

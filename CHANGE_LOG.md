## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### **Database Schema Design**
Created a comprehensive business intelligence database with 5 interconnected tables:

```sql
-- Products Table (10 sample records)
- id, name, category, price, description, stock_quantity
- Categories: Electronics, Clothing, Footwear
- Price range: $19.99 - $1,299.99

-- Customers Table (10 sample records) 
- id, name, email, phone, address, created_at
- Realistic customer profiles with complete contact information

-- Orders Table (50 sample records)
- id, customer_id, product_id, quantity, order_date, total_amount, status
- Order statuses: pending, completed, shipped, delivered, cancelled
- Date range: Past 6 months of realistic order data

-- Reviews Table (30 sample records)
- id, product_id, customer_id, rating, comment, created_at
- Ratings: 1-5 stars with detailed customer feedback

-- Sales Performance Table (60 sample records)
- id, product_id, month, year, units_sold, revenue, profit_margin
- Monthly performance data for trend analysis
```

### **API Key Configuration**
Securely configured external service integrations:
- **OpenAI API**: `your-openai-api-key-here` (configured in .env)
- **Tavily Research API**: `your-tavily-api-key-here` (configured in .env)

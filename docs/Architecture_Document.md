## 3. Data Flow Architecture

### 3.1 Business Intelligence Query Flow

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "Web UI" as UI
participant "FastAPI" as API
participant "RAG Engine" as RAG
participant "Agent Orchestrator" as Agents
participant "Vector Store" as Vector
participant "Company DB" as DB
participant "OpenAI" as OpenAI
participant "Tavily API" as Tavily

User -> UI: "What are our top selling products?"
UI -> API: POST /api/v1/chat/
API -> RAG: process_query()
RAG -> Agents: orchestrate_analysis()

Agents -> Vector: semantic_search()
Vector -> RAG: relevant_context
Agents -> DB: execute_sql_query()
DB -> RAG: query_results
Agents -> Tavily: external_research()
Tavily -> RAG: market_context

RAG -> OpenAI: generate_response()
OpenAI -> RAG: formatted_answer
RAG -> API: business_insight
API -> UI: JSON response
UI -> User: Formatted answer with sources

```

### 3.2 Database Generation Flow

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "Web UI" as UI
participant "FastAPI" as API
participant "DB Generator" as DBGen
participant "OpenAI" as OpenAI
participant "Data Populator" as DataPop
participant "SQLite DB" as DB

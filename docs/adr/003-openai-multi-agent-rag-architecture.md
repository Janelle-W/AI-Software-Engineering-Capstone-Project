# Architecture Decision Record 003: OpenAI and Multi-Agent RAG Architecture

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-10-03  
**Deciders:** Engineering Team  

## Context

Our Business Intelligence RAG Chatbot requires sophisticated natural language understanding and generation capabilities. The system must:
- Process complex business queries in natural language
- Generate accurate SQL queries from user intent
- Combine multiple data sources (database, documents, external research)
- Provide contextual, accurate responses with source attribution
- Handle multi-step analytical workflows

## Decision

We will implement a **Multi-Agent RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture** using **OpenAI GPT models** with specialized agents and **ChromaDB for vector storage**.

## Rationale

### OpenAI Selection:

#### Pros:
- **State-of-the-art NLP:** Best-in-class language understanding and generation
- **Structured Output:** Excellent at generating valid SQL and JSON
- **Context Handling:** Superior context window and conversation management
- **API Reliability:** Enterprise-grade API with high availability
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation and examples

#### Cons:
- **Cost:** Usage-based pricing can be expensive at scale
- **External Dependency:** Reliance on third-party service
- **Rate Limits:** API quotas may limit concurrent usage
- **Data Privacy:** Data sent to external service

### Multi-Agent Architecture:

#### Pros:
- **Specialization:** Each agent optimized for specific tasks
- **Modularity:** Easy to modify individual components
- **Scalability:** Can distribute agents across services
- **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns
- **Debugging:** Easier to trace and debug specific workflows

#### Cons:
- **Complexity:** More complex than single-agent systems
- **Coordination:** Requires orchestration between agents
- **Latency:** Multiple agent calls may increase response time

### Alternatives Considered:

1. **Anthropic Claude**
   - Pros: Strong reasoning, large context window, constitutional AI
   - Cons: Newer API, less tooling ecosystem, higher costs

2. **Local LLMs (Llama, Mistral)**
   - Pros: No external dependency, data privacy, cost control
   - Cons: Requires significant hardware, lower quality, complex setup

3. **Single Agent Architecture**
   - Pros: Simpler, fewer API calls, easier debugging
   - Cons: Less specialized, harder to optimize, monolithic

4. **Azure OpenAI**
   - Pros: Enterprise compliance, data residency options
   - Cons: Higher complexity, potentially higher costs, regional limitations

## Architecture Details

### Agent Orchestrator (`agents/orchestrator.py`):
```python
class AgentOrchestrator:
    - Routes queries to appropriate specialized agents
    - Manages conversation context and memory
    - Coordinates multi-step workflows
    - Handles error recovery and fallbacks
```

### Core RAG Engine (`app/core/rag_engine.py`):
```python
class BusinessRAGEngine:
    - Integrates multiple data sources
    - Manages vector store operations
    - Handles query processing pipeline
    - Coordinates response generation
```

### Query Processor (`app/core/query_processor.py`):
```python
class QueryProcessor:
    - Analyzes user intent and query type
    - Determines required data sources
    - Generates SQL queries from natural language
    - Validates and optimizes queries
```

### Vector Store (ChromaDB):
```python
# Document storage and retrieval
- Business documents indexed as vectors
- Semantic search capabilities
- Metadata filtering and categorization
- Persistent storage for embeddings
```

### External Research Integration:
```python
# Tavily API for market research
- Industry benchmarks and trends
- Competitive analysis data
- Market context for business insights
- Real-time external data enrichment
```

## Data Flow Architecture

```
User Query → Query Processor → Intent Analysis
     ↓
Multi-Source Data Retrieval:
├── SQL Database Query (structured data)
├── Vector Store Search (documents)
└── External API Research (market data)
     ↓
Response Generator → Context Builder → Final Response
```

## Consequences

### Positive:
- **High Quality:** State-of-the-art natural language capabilities
- **Flexibility:** Can handle diverse business intelligence queries
- **Accuracy:** RAG approach reduces hallucinations with source grounding
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new data sources and capabilities
- **User Experience:** Natural conversation interface

### Negative:
- **Cost:** OpenAI API costs scale with usage
- **Latency:** Multiple API calls increase response time
- **Complexity:** More components to maintain and debug
- **Dependencies:** External service reliability dependencies

### Neutral:
- **Development Speed:** Framework accelerates development
- **Performance:** Predictable within API rate limits
- **Maintenance:** Standard patterns for AI applications

## Implementation Guidelines

### API Key Management:
```python
# Secure environment variable storage
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
TAVILY_API_KEY = os.getenv("TAVILY_API_KEY")
```

### Error Handling:
- Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Fallback to cached responses when possible
- Clear error messages for users

### Performance Optimization:
- Connection pooling for API requests
- Response caching for repeated queries
- Async operations for parallel data retrieval
- Query result pagination for large datasets

### Quality Assurance:
- Source attribution for all generated content
- Confidence scoring for AI responses
- Query validation before database execution
- Response consistency checks

## Cost Management

### Optimization Strategies:
- Cache frequently asked questions and responses
- Use cheaper models for simple queries
- Implement query preprocessing to reduce token usage
- Monitor and alert on usage patterns

### Budget Controls:
- Rate limiting to prevent runaway costs
- Usage monitoring and reporting
- Fallback to simpler responses when budget limits approached

## Security and Privacy

### Data Protection:
- No sensitive business data in prompts when possible
- Sanitize database results before sending to OpenAI
- Implement data retention policies
- Regular security audits of data flows

### Access Control:
- API key rotation policies
- Audit logs for all AI interactions
- User authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting per user/company

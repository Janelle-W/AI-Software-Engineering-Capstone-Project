# Architecture Decision Record 001: FastAPI Framework Selection

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-10-03  
**Deciders:** Engineering Team  

## Context

We need to build a REST API backend for our Business Intelligence RAG Chatbot that can handle:
- Real-time chat interactions
- Database query execution
- Integration with multiple AI APIs (OpenAI, Tavily)
- File upload capabilities
- Multi-company data management

## Decision

We will use **FastAPI** as our backend web framework.

## Rationale

### Pros:
- **Automatic API Documentation:** Built-in OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation
- **Type Safety:** Full Python type hints support with automatic validation
- **Performance:** Built on Starlette/Uvicorn - one of the fastest Python frameworks
- **Async Support:** Native async/await support crucial for AI API calls
- **Modern Standards:** Follows modern Python standards (Python 3.6+ features)
- **Easy Testing:** Excellent testing capabilities with pytest integration
- **JSON Handling:** Native Pydantic models for request/response validation

### Cons:
- **Newer Framework:** Less mature ecosystem compared to Flask/Django
- **Learning Curve:** Requires understanding of async programming patterns
- **Documentation:** Some advanced features have limited documentation

### Alternatives Considered:

1. **Flask**
   - Pros: Mature, simple, large ecosystem
   - Cons: No built-in async support, manual API documentation, less type safety

2. **Django + DRF**
   - Pros: Mature, batteries-included, excellent ORM
   - Cons: Heavyweight for API-only service, complex for simple use cases

3. **Starlette**
   - Pros: Minimal, fast, async-first
   - Cons: Too low-level, requires more boilerplate

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Faster development with automatic documentation
- Better type safety reduces runtime errors
- Excellent performance for AI API integrations
- Modern codebase following current Python standards

### Negative:
- Team needs to learn async programming patterns
- Smaller community compared to Flask/Django
- May encounter edge cases with less community solutions

### Neutral:
- Standard REST API patterns remain the same
- Pydantic models provide clear data contracts

## Implementation Notes

- Use Pydantic models for all request/response schemas
- Leverage dependency injection for database connections and AI clients
- Implement proper error handling with FastAPI exception handlers
- Use background tasks for long-running operations

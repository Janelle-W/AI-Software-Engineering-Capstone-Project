# Docs Folder - The Documentation Center

## What This Folder Does (Simple Explanation)
This folder is like the instruction manual and reference guide for your entire business intelligence chatbot system. Just like when you buy a complex appliance and it comes with different guides - a quick start guide, detailed manual, troubleshooting section, and technical specifications - this folder contains all the documentation that helps developers, users, and administrators understand, use, and maintain the system effectively.

## Technical Description
The `docs/` directory contains comprehensive project documentation including API documentation, architecture decisions, deployment guides, and user manuals. It implements documentation-as-code principles with structured, version-controlled documentation that stays synchronized with the codebase.

### Structure:
- **`api_documentation.md`** - Complete API reference with endpoints, parameters, and examples
- **`architecture_decisions.md`** - Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) documenting key design choices
- **`deployment_guide.md`** - Step-by-step deployment instructions for different environments
- **`user_guide.md`** - End-user documentation for interacting with the chatbot
- **`developer_guide.md`** - Technical documentation for developers working on the system
- **`troubleshooting.md`** - Common issues, solutions, and debugging procedures
- **`configuration_reference.md`** - Detailed configuration options and environment settings
- **`data_schema.md`** - Database schema and data model documentation

### Key Documentation Types:
1. **API Documentation**: Complete reference for all endpoints and integrations
2. **Architecture Documentation**: System design decisions and technical rationale
3. **User Documentation**: How-to guides for end users and administrators
4. **Developer Documentation**: Technical implementation details and contribution guidelines
5. **Operational Documentation**: Deployment, monitoring, and maintenance procedures
6. **Troubleshooting Guides**: Problem resolution and debugging information

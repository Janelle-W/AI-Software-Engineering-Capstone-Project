# Agents Folder - The Specialist Team

## What This Folder Does (Simple Explanation)
Think of this folder as your team of business specialists, each expert in different areas. Just like in a real company, you might have a data analyst, a sales expert, a market researcher, and a report writer. When you ask the chatbot a question, it decides which "specialist" is best suited to help answer it, and sometimes even coordinates between multiple specialists to give you the most comprehensive response.

## Technical Description
The `agents/` directory implements a multi-agent architecture where specialized AI agents handle different types of business queries and analysis tasks. This follows the agent-based design pattern for complex problem decomposition and task specialization.

### Structure:
- **`orchestrator.py`** - Agent coordination and task routing system
- **`base_agent.py`** - Abstract base class defining agent interface and common functionality
- **`data_analyst_agent.py`** - SQL query generation and data extraction specialist
- **`business_advisor_agent.py`** - Strategic business insights and recommendations
- **`report_generator_agent.py`** - Formatted report creation and visualization
- **`trend_analysis_agent.py`** - Temporal pattern analysis and forecasting

### Key Technical Concepts:
1. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent has specific domain expertise and processing capabilities
2. **Task Routing**: Intelligent query classification and agent selection based on intent analysis
3. **Agent Coordination**: Orchestrated workflows where multiple agents collaborate on complex queries
4. **Context Sharing**: Agents share relevant context and intermediate results
5. **Response Synthesis**: Combining outputs from multiple agents into coherent responses
